# Kaggle---Telco-Customer-Churn
## Name
Telco Customer Churn Reasons 

## Description
Telco is a telecommunication company offering phone and internet services. The revenue comes from the customers' monthly subscription fees in its retail business. Understanding why customers cancel the service is essential to the business because the company can exploit the weak spots. Therefore, in the project, I will use Logistic Regression to determine the significant features for existing customers to churn, determined by the highest possibilities. 

## Results
Fiber optic internet service and month-to-month contract are the two primary reasons for customers to churn. To increase revenue by reducing the churn rate, Telco should improve its Fiber optic service and stimulate customers on a month-to-month contract to sign a one-year or two-year contract.

## Usage
The model is underfitting and should increase its complexity for future use. To read the dataset and run the code, please download the dataset from
